# Mobile Management for Mass Casualties.
M3C allows emergency responders to track casualties more effectively, in an effort to expedite disaster recovery and reunite family members with their loved ones.

The mobile app allows emergency responders to input data and upload to a central database, replacing the paper forms they currently use.
The web interface allows administrators to view records, and, eventually, will allow people to search for records of family members.
